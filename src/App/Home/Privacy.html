        <p class="sectionDescription">
            Google Analytics collects information about each computer connecting to this site such as IP address, dates and times of each login, device characteristics, operating system, browser type, type of connection, page and image viewing statistics, and incoming and outgoing links.
            This information is anonymized as soon as technically feasible. The IP anonymization feature in Analytics sets the last octet of IPv4 user IP addresses and the last 80 bits of IPv6 addresses to zeros in memory shortly after being sent to the Analytics Collection Network. The full IP address is never written to disk in this case.
